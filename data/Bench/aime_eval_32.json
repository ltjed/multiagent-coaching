    "solution": "This solution refers to the Diagram section.\nWe let $\\ell$ be the plane that passes through the spheres and $O_A$ and $O_B$ be the centers of the spheres with radii $11$ and $13$. We take a cross-section that contains $A$ and $B$, which contains these two spheres but not the third, as shown below:\n\nBecause the plane cuts out congruent circles, they have the same radius and from the given information, $AB = \\sqrt{560}$. Since $ABO_BO_A$ is a trapezoid, we can drop an altitude from $O_A$ to $BO_B$ to create a rectangle and triangle to use Pythagorean theorem. We know that the length of the altitude is $\\sqrt{560}$ and let the distance from $O_B$ to $D$ be $x$. Then we have $x^2 = 576-560 \\implies x = 4$.\nWe have $AO_A = BD$ because of the rectangle, so $\\sqrt{11^2-r^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-r^2}-4$.\nSquaring, we have $121-r^2 = 169-r^2 + 16 - 8 \\cdot \\sqrt{169-r^2}$.\nSubtracting, we get $8 \\cdot \\sqrt{169-r^2} = 64 \\implies \\sqrt{169-r^2} = 8 \\implies 169-r^2 = 64 \\implies r^2 = 105$.\nWe also notice that since we had $\\sqrt{169-r^2} = 8$ means that $BO_B = 8$ and since we know that $x = 4$, $AO_A = 4$.\nWe take a cross-section that contains $A$ and $C$, which contains these two spheres but not the third, as shown below:\n\nWe have $CO_C = \\sqrt{19^2-r^2} = \\sqrt{361 - 105} = \\sqrt{256} = 16$. Since $AO_A = 4$, we have $EO_C = 16-4 = 12$. Using Pythagorean theorem, $O_AE = \\sqrt{30^2 - 12^2} = \\sqrt{900-144} = \\sqrt{756}$.

We can use inradius or equilateral triangle properties to get the inradius of this triangle is $12$ (The incenter is also a centroid in an equilateral triangle, and the distance from a side to the centroid is a third of the height). Therefore, the radius of each of the smaller circles is $12$.\nLet $O=\\omega$ be the center of the largest circle. We will set up a coordinate system with $O$ as the origin. The center of $\\omega_A$ will be at $(0,-6)$ because it is directly beneath $O$ and is the length of the larger radius minus the smaller radius, or $18-12 = 6$. By rotating this point $120^{\\circ}$ around $O$, we get the center of $\\omega_B$. This means that the magnitude of vector $\\overrightarrow{O\\omega_B}$ is $6$ and is at a $30$ degree angle from the horizontal. Therefore, the coordinates of this point are $(3\\sqrt{3},3)$ and by symmetry the coordinates of the center of $\\omega_C$ is $(-3\\sqrt{3},3)$.\nThe upper left and right circles intersect at two points, the lower of which is $X$. The equations of these two circles are:\n\\begin{align*} (x+3\\sqrt3)^2 + (y-3)^2 &= 12^2, \\\\ (x-3\\sqrt3)^2 + (y-3)^2 &= 12^2. \\end{align*}\nWe solve this system by subtracting to get $x = 0$. Plugging back in to the first equation, we have $(3\\sqrt{3})^2 + (y-3)^2 = 144 \\implies (y-3)^2 = 117 \\implies y-3 = \\pm \\sqrt{117} \\implies y = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{117}$. Since we know $X$ is the lower solution, we take the negative value to get $X = (0,3-\\sqrt{117})$.\nWe can solve the problem two ways from here. We can find $Y$ by rotation and use the distance formula to find the length, or we can be somewhat more clever. We notice that it is easier to find $OX$ as they lie on the same vertical, $\\angle XOY$ is $120$ degrees so we can make use of $30-60-90$ triangles, and $OX = OY$ because $O$ is the center of triangle $XYZ$. We can draw the diagram as such:\n[asy] /* Made by MRENTHUSIASM */ size(300); pair A, B, C, B1, C1, W, WA, WB, WC, X, Y, Z; A = 18*dir(90); B = 18*dir(210); C = 18*dir(330); B1 = A+24*sqrt(3)*dir(B-A); C1 = A+24*sqrt(3)*dir(C-A); W = (0,0); WA = 6*dir(270); WB = 6*dir(30); WC = 6*dir(150); X = (sqrt(117)-3)*dir(270); Y = (sqrt(117)-3)*dir(30); Z = (sqrt(117)-3)*dir(150);  filldraw(X--Y--Z--cycle,green,dashed); draw(Circle(WA,12)^^Circle(WB,12)^^Circle(WC,12),blue); draw(Circle(W,18)^^A--B--C--cycle); draw(B--B1--C1--C^^W--X^^W--Y^^W--midpoint(X--Y),dashed); dot(\"$A$\",A,1.5*dir(A),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$B$\",B,1.5*(-1,0),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$C$\",C,1.5*(1,0),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$B'$\",B1,1.5*dir(B1),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$C'$\",C1,1.5*dir(C1),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$O$\",W,1.5*dir(90),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$X$\",X,1.5*dir(X),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$Y$\",Y,1.5*dir(Y),linewidth(4)); dot(\"$Z$\",Z,1.5*dir(Z),linewidth(4)); [/asy]\nNote that $OX = OY = \\sqrt{117} - 3$. It follows that\n\\begin{align*} XY &= 2 \\cdot \\frac{OX\\cdot\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ &= OX \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\\\ &= (\\sqrt{117}-3) \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\\\ &= \\sqrt{351}-\\sqrt{27}. \\end{align*}\nFinally, the answer is $351+27 = \\boxed{378}$.\n~KingRavi\nFor equilateral triangle with side length $l$, height $h$, and circumradius $r$, there are relationships: $h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} l$, $r = \\frac{2}{3} h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} l$, and $l = \\sqrt{3}r$.\nThere is a lot of symmetry in the figure. The radius of the big circle $\\odot \\omega$ is $R = 18$, let the radius of the small circles $\\odot \\omega_A$, $\\odot \\omega_B$, $\\odot \\omega_C$ be $r$.\nWe are going to solve this problem in $3$ steps:\n$\\textbf{Step 1:}$\nWe have $\\triangle A \\omega_A D$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle, and $A \\omega_A = 2 \\cdot \\omega_A D$, $A \\omega_A = 2R-r$ ($\\odot \\omega$ and $\\odot \\omega_A$ are tangent), and $\\omega_A D = r$. So, we get $2R-r = 2r$ and $r = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot R = 12$.\nSince $\\odot \\omega$ and $\\odot \\omega_A$ are tangent, we get $\\omega \\omega_A = R - r = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot R = 6$.\nNote that $\\triangle \\omega_A \\omega_B \\omega_C$ is an equilateral triangle, and $\\omega$ is its center, so $\\omega_B \\omega_C = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\omega \\omega_A = 6 \\sqrt{3}$.\n$\\textbf{Step 2:}$\nNote that $\\triangle \\omega_C E X$ is an isosceles triangle, so \\[EX = 2 \\sqrt{(\\omega_C E)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega_B \\omega_C}{2}\\right)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{r^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega_B \\omega_C}{2}\\right)^2} = 2 \\sqrt{12^2 - (3 \\sqrt{3})^2} = 2 \\sqrt{117}.\\]\n$\\textbf{Step 3:}$\nIn $\\odot \\omega_C$, Power of a Point gives $\\omega X \\cdot \\omega E = r^2 - (\\omega_C \\omega)^2$ and $\\omega E = EX - \\omega X = 2\\sqrt{117} - \\omega X$.\nIt follows that $\\omega X \\cdot (2\\sqrt{117} - \\omega X) = 12^2 - 6^2$. We solve this quadratic equation: $\\omega X = \\sqrt{117} - 3$.\nSince $\\omega X$ is the circumradius of equilateral $\\triangle XYZ$, we have $XY = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\omega X = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot (\\sqrt{117} - 3) = \\sqrt{351}-\\sqrt{27}$.\nTherefore, the answer is $351+27 = \\boxed{378}$.\n~[isabelchen](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Isabelchen)\n[AIME 2022 I 7.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:AIME_2022_I_7.png)\nLet $O$ be the center, $R = 18$ be the radius, and $CC'$ be the diameter of $\\omega.$ \nLet $r$  be the radius, $E,D,F$ are the centers of $\\omega_A, \\omega_B,\\omega_C.$ \nLet $KGH$ be the desired triangle with side  $x.$\nWe find $r$ using \n\\[CC' = 2R = C'K + KC = r + \\frac{r}{\\sin 30^\\circ} = 3r.\\]\n\\[r = \\frac{2R}{3} = 12.\\]\n\\[OE = R \u2013 r = 6.\\]\nTriangles $\\triangle DEF$ and $\\triangle KGH$ \u2013 are equilateral triangles with a common center $O,$ therefore in the triangle  $OEH$ $OE = 6, \\angle EOH = 120^\\circ, OH = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt3}.$\nWe apply the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle OEH$ and get\n\\[OE^2 + OH^2 + OE \\cdot OH = EH^2.\\]\n\\[6^2 + \\frac{x^2}{3} + \\frac{6x}{\\sqrt3} = 12^2.\\]\n\\[x^2 + 6x \\sqrt{3} = 324\\]\n\\[x= \\sqrt{351} - \\sqrt{27}  \\implies 351 + 27 = \\boxed {378}\\]\nvladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss\nLet $O$ be the center of $\\omega$, $X$ be the intersection of $\\omega_B,\\omega_C$ further from $A$, and $O_A$ be the center of $\\omega_A$.

Let $T_1, T_2, T_3$ be our tangents from the circle to the parallelogram. By the secant power of a point, the power of $A = 3 \\cdot (3+9) = 36$. Then $AT_2  = AT_3 = \\sqrt{36} = 6$. Similarly, the power of $C = 16 \\cdot (16+9) = 400$ and  $CT_1 = \\sqrt{400} = 20$. We let $BT_3 = BT_1 = x$ and label the diagram accordingly.\nNotice that because $BC = AD, 20+x = 6+DT_2 \\implies DT_2 = 14+x$. Let $O$ be the center of the circle. Since $OT_1$ and $OT_2$ intersect $BC$ and $AD$, respectively, at right angles, we have $T_2T_1CD$ is a right-angled trapezoid and more importantly, the diameter of the circle is the height of the triangle. Therefore, we can drop an altitude from $D$ to $BC$ and $C$ to $AD$, and both are equal to $2r$. Since $T_1E = T_2D$, $20 - CE = 14+x \\implies CE = 6-x$. Since $CE = DF, DF = 6-x$ and $AF = 6+14+x+6-x = 26$. We can now use Pythagorean theorem on $\\triangle ACF$; we have $26^2 + (2r)^2 = (3+9+16)^2 \\implies 4r^2 = 784-676 \\implies 4r^2 = 108 \\implies 2r = 6\\sqrt{3}$ and $r^2 = 27$.\nWe know that $CD = 6+x$ because $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.

Let points $M, N$ and $L$ be the tangent points of lines $BC, AD$ and $AB$ respectively to the circle. By Power of a Point, $({MC})^2=16\\cdot{25} \\Longrightarrow MC=20$. Similarly, $({AL})^2=3\\cdot{12} \\Longrightarrow AL=6$. Notice that $AL=AN=6$ since quadrilateral $LONA$ is symmetrical. Let $AC$ intersect $MN$ at $I$. Then, $\\bigtriangleup{IMC}$ is similar to $\\bigtriangleup{AIN}$. Therefore, $\\frac{CI}{MC}=\\frac{AI}{AN}$. Let the length of $PI=l$, then $\\frac{25-l}{20}=\\frac{3+l}{6}$. Solving we get $l=\\frac{45}{13}$. Doing the Pythagorean theorem on triangles $IMC$ and $AIN$ for sides $MI$ and $IN$ respectively, we obtain the equation $\\sqrt{(\\frac{280}{13})^2-400} +\\sqrt{(\\frac{84}{13})^2-36}=MN=2r_1$ where $r_1$ denotes the radius of the circle. Solving, we get $MN=6\\sqrt{3}$. Additionally, quadrilateral $OLBM$ is symmetrical so $OL=OM$. Let $OL=OM=x$ and extend a perpendicular foot from $B$ to $AD$ and call it $R$. Then, $\\bigtriangleup{ABR}$ is right with $AR=6-x$, $AB=6+x$, and $RB=2r_1=MN=6\\sqrt{3}$. Taking the difference of squares, we get $108=24x \\Longrightarrow x=\\frac{9}{2}$. The area of $ABCD$ is $MN\\cdot{BC}=(20+x)\\cdot{MN} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{49}{2}\\cdot{6\\sqrt{3}}=147\\sqrt{3}$.

Also, $H$ is the intersection of $XY$ (diameter) and $AC$ (diagonal). Then by power of a point with given info on $A$ and $C$ we get that $AY=6$ and $CX=20$. Note that $HAY \\sim HCX$, and since $\\frac{AY}{CX}=\\frac{3}{10}$ we note that \\[\\frac{AH}{CH} = \\frac{AP+PH}{CQ+QH} = \\frac{3+PH}{16+QH} =\\frac{AY}{CX}=\\frac{3}{10}\\]. Since $PH+HQ=9$, we get that $PH=\\frac{45}{13}$ and $QH=\\frac{72}{13}$. This is the length information within the circle.\nThe same triangle similarity also means that $\\frac{YH}{XH}=\\frac{3}{10}$, so if the radius of the circle is $r$ then we have $XH=\\frac{20}{13}r$ and $YH = \\frac{6}{13}r$. \nBy power of a point on H, we can figure out $r$:\n\\[XH\\cdot YH = PH \\cdot QG\\]\n\\[\\frac{20}{13}r \\cdot \\frac{6}{13}r = \\frac{45}{13} \\cdot \\frac{72}{13}\\]\nand we get that $r = 3 \\sqrt 3$. Thus, we have that the height of the parallelogram is $2r=6 \\sqrt 3$ and we want to find $BC$. If $AB$ is tangent to the circle at $E$, then set $a = BX = BE$. Using pythagorean theorem, $AO^2+BO^2=AB^2$ and we can plug in diagram values: \\[(AY^2+OY^2)+(BX^2+OX)^2=AB^2\\] \\[(6^2+(3 \\sqrt 3)^2) + (a^2+(3 \\sqrt 3)^2)=(a+6)^2.\\] Solving, we get $a=\\frac{9}{2}$ \nFinally, we have $[ABCD]=XY \\cdot BC = 6 \\sqrt 3 \\cdot (20+\\frac{9}{2}) \\rightarrow \\boxed{150}$\n~ Brocolimanx\nLet $E$, $F$, $G$ be the circle's point of tangency with sides $AD$, $AB$, and $BC$, respectively.

Similarly, $GC^2 = CQ \\cdot CP = 16(16+9) = 400$, so $GC = 20$.\nConstruct $GE$, and let $I$ be the point of intersection of $GE$ and $AC$. $GE \\perp BC$ and $GE \\perp AD$. By AA, $\\triangle IGC \\sim \\triangle IEA$, and we have $\\frac{AI}{IC} = \\frac{AE}{GC} = \\frac{3}{10}$. We also know $AI + IC = AC = 28$, so $AI = \\frac{84}{13}$ and $IC = \\frac{280}{13}$.\nUsing Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle IEA$ and $\\triangle CIG$, we find that $EI = \\frac{18\\sqrt{3}}{13}$ and $IG = \\frac{60\\sqrt{3}}{13}$. Thus, $GE = EI + IG = 6\\sqrt{3}$, and the radius of the circle is $3\\sqrt{3}$.\nConstruct $EF$, $FG$. $\\angle AFO = \\angle AEO = 90^{\\circ}$, so $AEOF$ is cyclic. Similarly, $BFOG$ is cyclic.\nNow, we attempt to set up Ptolemy. Using Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle AEO$, we find that $AO = 3\\sqrt{7}$. By Ptolemy's Theorem, $(AE)(FO) + (AF)(EO) = (AO)(FE)$, from which we have $(6)(3\\sqrt{3}) + (6)(3\\sqrt{3}) = (3\\sqrt{7})(FE)$ and $FE = 12\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{7}}$. From Thales' Circle, $\\triangle FGE$ is a right triangle, and $EF^2 + FG^2 = GE^2$, so $FG = \\frac{18}{\\sqrt{7}}$.\nSet $BF = BG = s$. $BO = \\sqrt{s^2 + (3\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{s^2+27}$, so by Ptolemy's Theorem on $BFOG$, we have\n\\[(BF)(GO) + (BG)(FO) = (FG)(BO)\\]\n\\[(3\\sqrt{3})(s) + (3\\sqrt{3})(s) = (\\frac{18}{\\sqrt{7}})(\\sqrt{s^2+27})\\]\nSolving yields $s = \\frac{9}{2}$.\nWe know that $BC = BG + GC = 20 + \\frac{9}{2} = \\frac{49}{2}$, so the area of $ABCD = (\\frac{49}{2})(6\\sqrt{3}) = 147\\sqrt{3}$.

We can therefore simplify the problem by finding all such numbers described above between $1$ and $60$ and multiplying the quantity of such numbers by $10$ ($600$/$60$ = $10$).\nAfter making a simple list of the numbers between $1$ and $60$ and going through it, we see that the numbers meeting this condition are $4$, $5$, $15$, $24$, $35$, $44$, $54$, and $55$.  This gives us $8$ numbers.  $8$ * $10$ = $\\boxed{080}$.\n\nSolution 1.5\nThis is Solution 1 with a slick element included.  Solution 1 uses the concept that $60k+l$ is a solution for $n$ if $60k+l$ is a multiple of $3$, $4$, and/or $5$ and $60k+l+1$ is a multiple of $3$, $4$, and/or $5$ for positive integer values of $l$ and essentially any integer value of $k$.  But keeping the same conditions in mind for $k$ and $l$, we can also say that if $60k+l$ is a solution, then $60k-l-1$ is a solution!  Therefore, one doesn't have to go as far as determining the number of values between $1$ and $60$ and then multiplying by $10$.  One only has to determine the number of values between $1$ and $30$ and then multiply by $20$.  The values of $n$ that work between $1$ and $30$ are $4$, $5$, $15$, and $24$.  This gives us $4$ numbers.  $4$ * $20$ = $\\boxed{080}$.\n\nNote\nSoon after the test was administered, a formal request was made to also accept $\\boxed{081}$ as an answer and MAA decided to honor this request.  The gist of this request stated that the phrasing of the first part of the question could reasonably be interpreted to mean that one is given the condition to begin with that the integer is less than or equal to $600$.  In this case, if one was told that the values of $\\left\\lfloor \\frac n4\\right\\rfloor$, $\\left\\lfloor\\frac n5\\right\\rfloor$, and $\\left\\lfloor\\frac n6\\right\\rfloor$ were $150$, $120$, and $100$ respectively, then the only possible choice for $n$ would be $600$ as $601$, $602$, and $603$ do not meet the condition as stated in the first part of the problem. If instead the problem asked for the numbers less than $600$ that met the second condition in the problem, there would have been one unique answer, $\\boxed{080}$. ~burkinafaso ~sethl\n1. For $n$ to be uniquely determined, $n$ AND $n + 1$ both need to be a multiple of $4, 5,$ or $6.$ Since either $n$ or $n + 1$ is odd, we know that either $n$ or $n + 1$ has to be a multiple of $5.$ We can state the following cases: \n1. $n$ is a multiple of $4$ and $n+1$ is a multiple of $5$\n2. $n$ is a multiple of $6$ and $n+1$ is a multiple of $5$\n3. $n$ is a multiple of $5$ and $n+1$ is a multiple of $4$\n4. $n$ is a multiple of $5$ and $n+1$ is a multiple of $6$\nSolving for each case, we see that there are $30$ possibilities for cases 1 and 3 each, and $20$ possibilities for cases 2 and 4 each. However, we over-counted the cases where \n1. $n$ is a multiple of $24$ and $n+1$ is a multiple of $5$\n2. $n$ is a multiple of $5$ and $n+1$ is a multiple of $24$\nEach case has $10$ possibilities.\nAdding all the cases and correcting for over-counting, we get $30 + 20 + 30 + 20 - 10 - 10 = \\boxed {080}.$\n~Lucasfunnyface\n\nSolution 2 Supplement\nHere is a detailed solution for Solution 2.\n\n$1.$ $4 \\mid n$, $5 \\mid n+1$\n$n = 4a$, $n+1 = 4a+1 = 5a - (a - 1)$, $a - 1 = 5k$, $a = 5k+1$, $n = 4(5k+1) = 20k+4$, $20k+4 \\le 600$, $20k \\le 596$, $k < 30$, $k \\in [0, 29]$, 30 integers.\n\n$2.$ $6 \\mid n$, $5 \\mid n+1$\n$n = 6a$, $n+1 = 6a+1 = 5a + a + 1$, $a + 1 = 5k$, $a = 5k-1$, $n = 6(5k-1) = 30k-6$, $30k-6 \\le 600$, $30k \\le 606$, $k \\le 20$, $k \\in [1, 20]$, 20 integers.\n\n$3.$ $5 \\mid n$, $4 \\mid n+1$\n$n = 5a$, $n+1 = 5a+1 = 4a + a + 1$, $a + 1 = 4k$, $a = 4k-1$, $n = 5(4k-1) = 20k-5$, $20k-5 \\le 600$, $20k \\le 605$, $k \\le 30$, $k \\in [1, 30]$, 30 integers.\n\n$4.$ $5 \\mid n$, $6 \\mid n+1$\n$n = 5a$, $n+1 = 5a+1 = 5(a - 1) + 6$, $a - 1 = 6k$, $a = 6k+1$, $n = 5(6k+1) = 30k+5$, $30k+5 \\le 600$, $30k \\le 595$, $k < 20$, $k \\in [0, 19]$, 20 integers.\n\nOver-counted cases:\n\n$1.$ $24 \\mid n$, $5 \\mid n+1$\n$n = 24a$, $n + 1= 24a + 1 = 20a + 4a + 1$, $4a+1 = 5k$, $k = 2p+1$, $4a = 5(2p + 1) - 1 = 10p + 4$, $n = 24a = 6(10p + 4) = 60p+24$, $60p + 24 \\le 600$, $5p + 2 \\le 50$, $5p \\le 48$, $p < 10$, $p \\in [0, 9]$, 10 integers.\n\n$2.$ $5 \\mid n$, $24 \\mid n+1$\n$n + 1= 5a + 1 = 24a$, $n = 24a - 1 = 20a + 4a - 1$, $4a-1 = 5k$, $k = 2p+1$, $4a = 5(2p + 1) + 1 = 10p + 6$, $n = 24a = 6(10p + 6) = 60p+36$, $60p + 36 \\le 600$, $5p + 3 \\le 50$, $5p \\le 47$, $p < 10$, $k \\in [0, 9]$, 10 integers.\n\n$30 + 20 + 30 + 20 - 10 - 10 = \\boxed{\\textbf{080}}$\n~[isabelchen](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Isabelchen)\nThe problem is the same as asking how many unique sets of values of $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{4}\\rfloor$, $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{5}\\rfloor$, and $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{6}\\rfloor$ can be produced by one and only one value of $n$ for positive integers $n$ less than or equal to 600.\nSeeing that we are dealing with the unique values of the floor function, we ought to examine when it is about to change values, for instance, when $n$ is close to a multiple of 4 in $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{4}\\rfloor$.\nFor a particular value of $n$, let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the original values of $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{4}\\rfloor$, $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{5}\\rfloor$, and $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{6}\\rfloor$, respectively.\nNotice when $n$ $\\equiv0\\mod4$ and $n$ $\\equiv4\\mod5$, the value of $\\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{4}\\rfloor$ will be 1 less than the original $a$.

We subtract $1$ from the total since $1001$ satisfies the criteria but is greater than $1000$ to get a final answer of $\\fbox{363}$ .\n~[Bxiao31415](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Bxiao31415)\n(small changes by bobjoebilly and [IraeVid13](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Iraevid13))\nWe first check that $\\gcd(23, 2^n) = 1$ hence we are always seeking a unique modular inverse of $23$, $b_n$, such that $a_n \\equiv 23b_n \\equiv 1 \\mod{2^n}$.\n\nNow that we know that $b_n$ is unique, we proceed to recast this problem in binary. This is convenient because $x \\mod{2^n}$ is simply the last $n$-bits of $x$ in binary, and if $x \\equiv 1 \\mod{2^n}$, it means that of the last $n$ bits of $x$, only the rightmost bit (henceforth $0$th bit) is $1$.\nAlso, multiplication in binary can be thought of as adding shifted copies of the multiplicand. For example:\n\\begin{align} 10111_2 \\times 1011_2 &= 10111_2 \\times (1000_2 + 10_2 + 1_2) \\\\               &= 10111000_2 + 101110_2 + 10111_2 \\\\               &= 11111101_2 \\end{align}\nNow note $23 = 10111_2$, and recall that our objective is to progressively zero out the $n$ leftmost bits of $a_n = 10111_2 \\times b_n$ except for the $0$th bit. \nWrite $b_n = \\underline{c_{n-1}\\cdots c_2c_1c_0}_2$, we note that $c_0$ uniquely defines the $0$th bit of $a_n$, and once we determine $c_0$, $c_1$ uniquely determines the $1$st bit of $a_n$, so on and so forth. \nFor example, $c_0 = 1$ satisfies $a_1 \\equiv10111_2 \\times 1_2 \\equiv 1 \\mod{10_2}$\nNext, we note that the second bit of $a_1$ is $1$, so we must also have $c_1 = 1$ in order to zero it out, giving\n\\[a_2 \\equiv 10111_2 \\times 11_2 \\equiv 101110_2 + a_1 \\equiv 1000101_2 \\equiv 01_2 \\mod{100_2}\\]\n$a_{n+1} = a_{n}$ happens precisely when $c_n = 0$. In fact we can see this in action by working out $a_3$. Note that $a_2$ has 1 on the $2$nd bit, so we must choose $c_2 = 1$. This gives \n\\[a_3 \\equiv 10111_2 \\times 111_2 \\equiv 1011100_2 + a_2 \\equiv 10100001_2 \\equiv 001_2 \\mod{1000_2}\\]\nNote that since the $3$rd and $4$th bit are $0$, $c_3 = c_4 = 0$, and this gives $a_3 = a_4 = a_5$.\n\nIt may seem that this process will take forever, but note that $23 = 10111_2$ has $4$ bits behind the leading digit, and in the worst case, the leading digits of $a_n$ will have a cycle length of at most $16$. In fact, we find that the cycle length is $11$, and in the process found that $a_3 = a_4 = a_5$, $a_6 = a_7$, and $a_{11} = a_{12}$.\nSince we have $90$ complete cycles of length $11$, and the last partial cycle yields $a_{993} = a_{994} = a_{995}$ and $a_{996} = a_{997}$, we have a total of $90 \\times 4 + 3 = \\boxed{363}$ values of $n \\le 1000$ such that $a_n = a_{n+1}$\n~ cocoa @ [https://www.corgillogical.com](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://www.corgillogical.com)",

If $b=8$, then $16\\sqrt 3\\leq a\\leq 32$. Note that $\\gcd(a,b)=1$, and $a\\not\\equiv b\\pmod 2$, so $a=29$ or $31$.

If $b=6$, by the same logic, $12\\sqrt3<a<24$, so $a=23$, where we run into the same problem. Thus $b\\leq 5$ indeed.\nIf $b=5$, note that\n\\[(a+5)(a^2+25-20a)<a^2+25\\implies a<20\\]We note that $p=5^2+18^2=349$ works. Thus, we just need to make sure that if $b\\leq 4$, $a\\leq 18$.

Thus, $a^2 + b^2 = p$.\nThus,\n\\[z^3 = a \\left( a^2 - 3 b^2 \\right) + i b \\left( - b^2 + 3 a^2 \\right) .\\]\nBecause $p$, ${\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right)$, ${\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right)$ are three sides of a triangle, we have ${\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right) > 0$ and ${\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right) > 0$.\nThus,\n\\begin{align*} a \\left( a^2 - 3 b^2 \\right) & > 0 , \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\\\ b \\left( - b^2 + 3 a^2 \\right) & > 0. \\hspace{1cm} (2) \\end{align*}\nBecause $p$, ${\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right)$, ${\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right)$ are three sides of a triangle, we have the following triangle inequalities:\n\\begin{align*} {\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right) + {\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right) & > p \\hspace{1cm} (3) \\\\ p + {\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right) & > {\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right) \\hspace{1cm} (4) \\\\ p + {\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right) & > {\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right) \\hspace{1cm} (5) \\end{align*}\nWe notice that $| z^3 | = p^{3/2}$, and ${\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right)$, ${\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right)$, and $| z^3 |$ form a right triangle. Thus, ${\\rm Re} z^3 + {\\rm Im} z^3 > p^{3/2}$.\nBecause $p > 1$, $p^{3/2} > p$.\nTherefore, (3) holds.\nConditions (4) and (5) can be written in the joint form as\n\\[\\left| {\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right) - {\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right) \\right| < p . \\hspace{1cm} (4)\\]\n\nWe have\n\\begin{align*} {\\rm Re} \\left( z^3 \\right) - {\\rm Im} \\left( z^3 \\right) & = \\left( a^3 - 3 a b^2 \\right) - \\left( - b^3 + 3 a^2 b \\right) \\\\ & = \\left( a + b \\right) \\left( a^2 - 4 ab + b^2 \\right) \\end{align*}\nand $p = a^2 + b^2$.\nThus, (5) can be written as\n\\[\\left| \\left( a + b \\right) \\left( a^2 - 4 ab + b^2 \\right)  \\right| < a^2 + b^2 . \\hspace{1cm} (6)\\]\nTherefore, we need to jointly solve (1), (2), (6).\nFrom (1) and (2), we have either $a, b >0$, or $a, b < 0$.\nIn (6), by symmetry, without loss of generality, we assume $a, b > 0$.\nThus, (1) and (2) are reduced to\n\\[a > \\sqrt{3} b . \\hspace{1cm} (7)\\]\nLet $a = \\lambda b$.

Denote the parallelepiped with three acute angles meeting $P$, and the one with three obtuse angles meeting $P'$.\nThe area of a parallelepiped is simply the base area times the height, but because both parallelepipeds have the same base, what we want is just the ratio of the heights.\nDenote the point with three acute angles meeting at it in $P$ as $A$, and its neighbors $B$, $C$, and $D$.

We can now rewrite the exponents of each product (two at a time, where $1$ is treated as the identity) as a series of arrays: \n\\[\\textbf{(A)}\\begin{bmatrix} 3&1 &0 \\\\ 18&6&0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\\[\\textbf{(B)}\\begin{bmatrix} 6&2 &0 \\\\ 15&5&0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\\[\\textbf{(C)}\\begin{bmatrix} 9&3 &0 \\\\ 12&4&0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\nNote that $\\omega=e^{\\frac{2\\pi i}{7}}$. When raising $\\omega$ to a power, the numerator of the fraction is $2$ times whatever power $\\omega$ is raised to, multiplied by $\\pi i$. Since the period of $\\omega$ is $2\\pi,$ we multiply each array by $2$ then reduce each entry $\\mod{14},$ as each entry in an array represents an exponent which $\\omega$ is raised to.\n\n\\[\\textbf{(A)}\\begin{bmatrix} 6&2 &0 \\\\ 8&12&0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\\[\\textbf{(B)}\\begin{bmatrix} 12&4 &0 \\\\ 2&10&0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\\[\\textbf{(C)}\\begin{bmatrix} 4&6 &0 \\\\ 10&8&0\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nTo obtain the correct exponents, we seperately add each element of the lower row to one element of the top row. \nTherefore (after reducing $\\mod 14$ again), we get the following sets: \n\\[\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\{0, 4, 6, 10, 0, 2, 8, 12, 0\\}\\]\n\\[\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\{0, 8, 12, 6, 0, 4, 2, 10, 0\\}\\]\n\\[\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\{0, 12, 4, 2, 0, 8, 10, 8, 0\\}.\\]\nRaising $\\omega$ to the power of each element in every set then multiplying over $\\textbf{(A)}, \\textbf{(B)},$ and $\\textbf{(C)}$ yields \n\\[\\frac{1}{3} \\prod_{k=0}^6 \\left(\\omega^{3k} + \\omega^k + 1\\right)=\\left(\\sum_{a\\in \\textbf{(A)}} \\omega^a\\right)\\left(\\sum_{b\\in \\textbf{(B)}} \\omega^b\\right)\\left(\\sum_{c\\in \\textbf{(C)}} \\omega^c\\right)\\]\n\\[=\\left(\\sum_{a\\in \\textbf{(A)}} \\omega^a\\right)^3\\]\n\\[=\\left(\\omega^0+\\omega^4+\\omega^6+\\omega^{10}+\\omega^0+\\omega^2+\\omega^8+\\omega^{12}+\\omega^0\\right)^3\\]\n\\[=\\left(3+\\omega^2+\\omega^4+\\omega^6+\\omega^8+\\omega^{10}+\\omega^{12}\\right)^3,\\]\nas these sets are all identical. \nSumming as a geometric series, \n\\[\\frac{1}{3} \\prod_{k=0}^6 \\left(\\omega^{3k} + \\omega^k + 1\\right)=\\left(3+\\frac{\\omega^2(\\omega^{12}-1)}{\\omega^2-1}\\right)^3\\]\n\\[=\\left(3+\\frac{\\omega^{14}-\\omega^2}{\\omega^2-1}\\right)^3\\]\n\\[=\\left(3+\\frac{1-\\omega^2}{\\omega^2-1}\\right)^3\\]\n\\[=(3-1)^3=8.\\]\nTherefore, \n\\[\\frac{1}{3} \\prod_{k=0}^6 \\left(\\omega^{3k} + \\omega^k + 1\\right)=8,\\]\nand \n\\[\\prod_{k=0}^6 \\left(\\omega^{3k} + \\omega^k + 1\\right)=3\\cdot8=\\boxed{\\textbf{(024)}}.\\]\n-Benedict T (countmath1)\nThe product can be factored into $-(r-1)(s-1)(t-1)(r-w)(s-w)(t-w)(r-w^2)(s-w^2)(t-w^2)....(r-w^6)(s-w^6)(t-w^6)$,\n\nwhere $r,s,t$ are the roots of the polynomial $x^3+x+1=0$. \n\nThis is then $-(r^7-1)(s^7-1)(t^7-1)$ because $(r^7-1)$ and $(r-1)(r-w)(r-w^2)...(r-w^6)$ share the same roots. \n\nTo find $-(r^7-1)(s^7-1)(t^7-1)$,\n\nNotice that $(r^7-1)=(r-1)(r^6+r^5+r^4+r^3+r^2+r+1)$. Since r satisfies $x^3+x+1=0$, $r^6+r^4+r^3=0$\n\nSubstituting, you are left with $r^5+r^2+r+1$. This is $r^2(r^3+1)+r+1$, and after repeatedly substituting $r^3+x+1=0$ you are left with $-2r^3$. \n\nSo now the problem is reduced to finding $-(r-1)(s-1)(t-1)(-2r^3)(-2s^3)(-2t^3)=8(rst)^3(r-1)(s-1)(t-1)$, and vietas gives you the result of $\\boxed{24}$ -resources",

Let $PA = a$, $PB = b$, $PC = c$, $PD = d$, and $AB = s$. We have $a^2 + c^2 = AC^2 = 2s^2$, because $AC$ is a diameter of the circle. Similarly, $b^2 + d^2 = 2s^2$. Therefore, $(a+c)^2 = a^2 + c^2 + 2ac = 2s^2 + 2(56) = 2s^2 + 112$. Similarly, $(b+d)^2 = 2s^2 + 180$. \nBy Ptolemy's Theorem on $PCDA$, $as + cs = ds\\sqrt{2}$, and therefore $a + c = d\\sqrt{2}$. By Ptolemy's on $PBAD$, $bs + ds = as\\sqrt{2}$, and therefore $b + d = a\\sqrt{2}$. By squaring both equations, we obtain\n\\begin{alignat*}{8} 2d^2 &= (a+c)^2 &&= 2s^2 + 112, \\\\ 2a^2 &= (b+d)^2 &&= 2s^2 + 180. \\end{alignat*}\nThus, $a^2 = s^2 + 90$, and $d^2 = s^2 + 56$. Plugging these values into $a^2 + c^2 = b^2 + d^2 = 2s^2$, we obtain $c^2 = s^2 - 90$, and $b^2 = s^2 - 56$. Now, we can solve using $a$ and $c$ (though using $b$ and $d$ yields the same solution for $s$).\n\\begin{align*} ac = (\\sqrt{s^2 - 90})(\\sqrt{s^2 + 90}) &= 56 \\\\ (s^2 + 90)(s^2 - 90) &= 56^2 \\\\ s^4 &= 90^2 + 56^2 = 106^2 \\\\ s^2 &= \\boxed{106}. \\end{align*}\n~mathboy100\nBy the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we conclude that $\\triangle PAC$ and $\\triangle PBD$ are right triangles.\nLet the brackets denote areas.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have \\[PX^2+PY^2=PO^2.\\]\nWe rewrite this equation in terms of $d:$ \\[\\left(\\frac{56}{d}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{90}{d}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac d2\\right)^2,\\] from which $d^2=212.$ Therefore, we get \\[[ABCD] = \\frac{d^2}{2} = \\boxed{106}.\\]\n~MRENTHUSIASM\nLet the center of the circle be $O$, and the radius of the circle be $r$. Since $ABCD$ is a rhombus with diagonals $2r$ and $2r$, its area is $\\dfrac{1}{2}(2r)(2r) = 2r^2$. Since $AC$ and $BD$ are diameters of the circle, $\\triangle APC$ and $\\triangle BPD$ are right triangles. Let $X$ and $Y$ be the foot of the altitudes to $AC$ and $BD$, respectively. We have\n\\[[\\triangle APC] = \\frac{1}{2}(PA)(PC) = \\frac{1}{2}(PX)(AC),\\]\nso $PX = \\dfrac{(PA)(PC)}{AC} = \\dfrac{28}{r}$. Similarly,\n\\[[\\triangle BPD] = \\frac{1}{2}(PB)(PD) = \\frac{1}{2}(PY)(PB),\\]\nso $PY = \\dfrac{(PB)(PD)}{BD} = \\dfrac{45}{r}$. Since $\\triangle APX \\sim \\triangle PCX,$\n\\[\\frac{AX}{PX} = \\frac{PX}{CX}\\]\n\\[\\frac{AO - XO}{PX} = \\frac{PX}{OC + XO}.\\]\nBut $PXOY$ is a rectangle, so $PY = XO$, and our equation becomes\n\\[\\frac{r - PY}{PX} = \\frac{PX}{r + PY}.\\]\nCross multiplying and rearranging gives us $r^2 = PX^2 + PY^2 = \\left(\\dfrac{28}{r}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{45}{r}\\right)^2$, which rearranges to $r^4 = 2809$.

Notice that the intersection of the diagonals of $\\square ABCD$ meets at a right angle at the center of the circumcircle, call this intersection point $O$.\nSince $OXPY$ is a rectangle, $OX$ is the distance from $P$ to line $\\overline{BD}$. We know that $\\tan{\\angle{POX}} = \\frac{PX}{XO} = \\frac{28}{45}$ by triangle area and given information. Then, notice that the measure of $\\angle{OCP}$ is half of $\\angle{XOP}$.\nUsing the half-angle formula for tangent,\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{(2 \\cdot \\tan{\\angle{OCP}})}{(1-\\tan^2{\\angle{OCP}})} = \\tan{\\angle{POX}} = \\frac{28}{45} \\\\ 14\\tan^2{\\angle{OCP}} + 45\\tan{\\angle{OCP}} - 14 = 0 \\end{align*}\nSolving the equation above, we get that $\\tan{\\angle{OCP}} = -7/2$ or $2/7$. Since this value must be positive, we pick $\\frac{2}{7}$. Then, $\\frac{PA}{PC} = 2/7$ (since $\\triangle CAP$ is a right triangle with line $\\overline{AC}$ the diameter of the circumcircle) and $PA * PC = 56$.

We can use the [Law of Cosines](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Law_of_Cosines) on isosceles triangles $\\triangle AOP, \\, \\triangle COP, \\, \\triangle BOP, \\, \\triangle DOP$ to get \n\\begin{align*} \t PA^2 &= 2r^2(1 - \\cos \\theta), \\\\\t PC^2 &= 2r^2(1 - \\cos (180  - \\theta)) = 2r^2(1 + \\cos \\theta), \\\\\t PB^2 &= 2r^2(1 - \\cos (90 - \\theta)) = 2r^2(1 - \\sin \\theta), \\\\\t PD^2 &= 2r^2(1 - \\cos (90 + \\theta)) = 2r^2(1 + \\sin \\theta).\t \\end{align*}\nTaking the products of the first two and last two equations, respectively, \\[56^2 = (PA \\cdot PC)^2 = 4r^4(1 - \\cos \\theta)(1 + \\cos \\theta) = 4r^4(1 - \\cos^2 \\theta) = 4r^4 \\sin^2 \\theta,\\] and \\[90^2 = (PB \\cdot PD)^2 = 4r^4(1 - \\sin \\theta)(1 + \\sin \\theta) = 4r^4(1 - \\sin^2 \\theta) = 4r^4 \\cos^2 \\theta.\\]\t\nAdding these equations, \\[56^2 + 90^2 = 4r^4,\\] so  \t\n\\[2r^2 = \\sqrt{56^2+90^2} = 2\\sqrt{28^2+45^2} = 2\\sqrt{2809} = 2 \\cdot 53 = \\boxed{106}.\\]\t\n~OrangeQuail9\nFirst draw a diagram.\n\nLet's say that the radius is $r$. Then the area of the $ABCD$ is $(\\sqrt2r)^2 = 2r^2$\nUsing the formula for the length of a chord subtended by an angle, we get\n\\[PA = 2r\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}2\\right)\\]\n\\[PC = 2r\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{180-\\theta}2\\right) = 2r\\sin\\left(90 - \\dfrac{\\theta}2\\right) = 2r\\cos\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}2\\right)\\]\nMultiplying and simplifying these 2 equations gives\n\\[PA \\cdot PC = 4r^2 \\sin \\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}2 \\right) \\cos \\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}2 \\right) = 2r^2 \\sin\\left(\\theta \\right) = 56\\]\nSimilarly $PB = 2r\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{90 +\\theta}2\\right)$ and $PD =2r\\sin\\left(\\dfrac{90 -\\theta}2\\right)$. Again, multiplying gives\n\\[PB \\cdot PD = 4r^2 \\sin\\left(\\dfrac{90 +\\theta}2\\right) \\sin\\left(\\dfrac{90 -\\theta}2\\right) = 4r^2 \\sin\\left(90 -\\dfrac{90 -\\theta}2\\right) \\sin\\left(\\dfrac{90 -\\theta}2\\right)\\]\n\\[=4r^2 \\sin\\left(\\dfrac{90 -\\theta}2\\right) \\cos\\left(\\dfrac{90 -\\theta}2\\right) = 2r^2 \\sin\\left(90 - \\theta \\right) = 2r^2 \\cos\\left(\\theta \\right) = 90\\]\nDividing $2r^2 \\sin \\left(\\theta \\right)$ by $2r^2 \\cos \\left( \\theta \\right)$ gives $\\tan \\left(\\theta \\right) = \\dfrac{28}{45}$, so $\\theta = \\tan^{-1} \\left(\\dfrac{28}{45} \\right)$.\nPluging this back into one of the equations, gives\n\\[2r^2 = \\dfrac{90}{\\cos\\left(\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{28}{45}\\right)\\right)}\\]\nIf we imagine a $28$-$45$-$53$ right triangle, we see that if $28$ is opposite and $45$ is adjacent, $\\cos\\left(\\theta\\right) = \\dfrac{\\text{adj}}{\\text{hyp}} = \\dfrac{45}{53}$. Now we see that\n\\[2r^2 = \\dfrac{90}{\\frac{45}{53}} = \\boxed{106}.\\]\n~Voldemort101\nLet $P=(a,b)$ on the upper quarter of the circle, and let $k$ be the side length of the square. Hence, we want to find $k^2$. Let the center of the circle be $(0,0)$.\nThe two equations would thus become:\n\\[\\left(\\left(a+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)\\left(\\left(a-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)=56^2\\]\n\\[\\left(\\left(a-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)\\left(\\left(a+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2+\\left(b+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2\\right)=90^2\\]\nNow, let $m=\\left(a+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$, $n=\\left(a-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$, $o=\\left(b+\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$, and $p=\\left(b-\\dfrac{k}2\\right)^2$. Our equations now change to $(m+p)(n+o)=56^2=mn+op+mo+pn$ and $(n+p)(m+o)=90^2=mn+op+no+pm$. Subtracting the first from the second, we have $pm+no-mo-pn=p(m-n)-o(m-n)=(m-n)(p-o)=34\\cdot146$. Substituting back in and expanding, we have $2ak\\cdot-2bk=34\\cdot146$, so $abk^2=-17\\cdot73$. We now have one of our terms we need ($k^2$). Therefore, we only need to find $ab$ to find $k^2$.\nWe now write the equation of the circle, which point $P$ satisfies: \\[a^2+b^2=\\left(\\dfrac{k\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2=\\dfrac{k^2}2\\]\nWe can expand the second equation, yielding \\[\\left(a^2+b^2+\\dfrac{k^2}2+(ak+bk)\\right)\\left(a^2+b^2+\\dfrac{k^2}2-(ak+bk)\\right)=(k^2+k(a+b))(k^2-k(a+b))=8100.\\]\nNow, with difference of squares, we get $k^4-k^2\\cdot(a+b)^2=k^2(k^2-(a+b)^2)=8100$. We can add $2abk^2=-17\\cdot73\\cdot2=-2482$ to this equation, which we can factor into $k^2(k^2-(a+b)^2+2ab)=k^2(k^2-(a^2+b^2))=8100-2482$. We realize that $a^2+b^2$ is the same as the equation of the circle, so we plug its equation in: $k^2\\left(k^2-\\dfrac{k^2}2\\right)=5618$. We can combine like terms to get $k^2\\cdot\\dfrac{k^2}2=5618$, so $(k^2)^2=11236$.\nSince the answer is an integer, we know $11236$ is a perfect square. Since it is even, it is divisible by $4$, so we can factor $11236=2^2\\cdot2809$. With some testing with approximations and last-digit methods, we can find that $53^2=2809$. Therefore, taking the square root, we find that $k^2$, the area of square $ABCD$, is $2\\cdot53=\\boxed{106}$.\n~wuwang2002\nWLOG, let $P$ be on minor arc $AD.$ Draw in $AP$, $BP$, $CP$, $DP$ and let $\\angle ABP = x.$  We can see, by the inscribed angle theorem, that $\\angle APB = \\angle ACB = 45$, and $\\angle CPD = \\angle CAD = 45.$ Then, $\\angle PAB = 135-x$, $\\angle PCD = \\angle PAD = (135-x)-90 = 45-x$, and $\\angle PDC = 90+x.$ Letting $(PA, PB, PC, PD, AB) = (a,b,c,d,s)$, we can use the law of sines on triangles $PAB$ and $PCD$ to get \\[s\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sin(x)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(135-x)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(90+x)} = \\frac{d}{\\sin(45-x)}.\\] Making all the angles in the above equation acute gives \\[s\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sin(x)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(45+x)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(90-x)} = \\frac{d}{\\sin(45-x)}.\\]\nNote that we are looking for $s^{2}.$ We are given that $ac = 56$ and $bd = 90.$ This means that\n$s^{2}\\sin(x)\\sin(90-x) = 28$ and $s^{2}\\sin(45+x)\\sin(45-x) = 45.$ However, \\[\\sin(x)\\sin(90-x) = \\sin(x)\\cos(x) = \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{2}\\] and \\[\\sin(45+x)\\sin(45-x) = \\frac{(\\cos(x) + \\sin(x))(\\cos(x) - \\sin(x))}{2} = \\frac{\\cos^{2}(x) - \\sin^{2}(x)}{2} = \\frac{\\cos(2x)}{2}.\\]  Therefore, $s^{2}\\sin(2x) = 56$ and $s^{2}\\cos(2x) = 90.$ Therefore, by the Pythagorean Identity, \\[s^{2} = \\sqrt{(s^{2}\\sin(2x))^{2} + (s^{2}\\cos(2x))^{2}} = \\sqrt{56^{2} + 90^{2}} = \\boxed{106}.\\]\n~pianoboy\nSimilar to Solution 6, let $P$ be on minor arc $\\overarc {AB}$, $r$ and $O$ be the radius and center of the circumcircle respectively, and $\\theta = \\angle AOP$. Since $\\triangle APC$ is a right triangle, $PA \\cdot PC$ equals the hypotenuse, $2r$, times its altitude, which can be represented as $r \\sin \\theta$. Therefore, $2r^2 \\sin \\theta = 56$. Applying similar logic to $\\triangle BPD$, we get $2r^2 \\sin (90^\\circ - \\theta) = 2r^2 \\cos \\theta = 90$.\nDividing the two equations, we have\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\sin \\theta}{\\cos \\theta} &= \\frac{56}{90} \\\\ 56 \\cos \\theta &= 90 \\sin \\theta \\\\ (56 \\cos \\theta)^2 &= (90 \\sin \\theta)^2. \\end{align*}\nAdding $(56 \\sin \\theta)^2$ to both sides allows us to get rid of $\\cos \\theta$:\n\\begin{align*} (56 \\cos \\theta)^2 + (56 \\sin \\theta)^2 &= (90 \\sin \\theta)^2 + (56 \\sin \\theta)^2 \\\\ 56^2 &= (90^2 + 56^2)(\\sin \\theta)^2 \\\\ \\frac{56^2}{90^2 + 56^2} &= (\\sin \\theta)^2 \\\\ \\frac{28}{53} &= \\sin \\theta. \\end{align*}\nTherefore, we have $2r^2\\left(\\frac{28}{53}\\right) = 56$, and since the area of the square can be represented as $2r^2$, the answer is $56 \\cdot \\frac{53}{28} = \\boxed{106}$.\n~phillipzeng",

    "solution": "If we graph $4g(f(x))$, we see it forms a sawtooth graph that oscillates between $0$ and $1$ (for values of $x$ between $-1$ and $1$, which is true because the arguments are between $-1$ and $1$). Thus by precariously drawing the graph of the two functions in the square bounded by $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$, and hand-counting each of the intersections, we get $\\boxed{385}$\n\nNote\nWhile this solution might seem unreliable (it probably is), the only parts where counting the intersection might be tricky is near $(1,1)$. Make sure to count them as two points and not one, or you'll get $384$.\nWe will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1.\n\nWe notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\\frac{3}{4}, -\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\\frac{1}{2}, 0,\\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\\cdot24=384$ intersections.\n\nHowever, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\\boxed{385}$.\n~Xyco\nWe can easily see that only $x, y \\in \\left[0,1 \\right]$ may satisfy both functions.\nWe call function $y = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\sin \\left( 2 \\pi x \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 1 and function $x = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\cos \\left( 3 \\pi y \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 2.\nFor Function 1, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$, Function 1's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, $\\frac{i+1}{4}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1. \nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nFor Function 2, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{6} , \\frac{i+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 5 \\right\\}$, Function 2's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $y = \\frac{i}{6}$, $\\frac{i+1}{6}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1.\nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic curves.\nConsider any region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$.\nBoth functions have four monotonic pieces.\nBecause Function 1's each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ and Function 2' each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$, Function 1's each monotonic piece intersects with Function 2's each monotonic piece. \nTherefore, in the interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$, the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$.\nNext, we prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $x = \\frac{i}{4}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 4 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nFor $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, Function 1 attains value 1. \nFor Function 2, if $y = 1$, then $x = 1$. \nTherefore, the intersecting point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nSimilarly, we can prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $y = \\frac{i}{6}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 6 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nTherefore, in each region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$, all 16 intersecting points are interior.\nThat is, no two regions share any common intersecting point.\nNext, we study region  $\\left[ \\frac{3}{4} , 1 \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{5}{6} , 1 \\right]$.\nConsider any pair of monotonic pieces, where one is from Function 1 and one is from Function 2, except the pair of two monotonic pieces from two functions that attain $\\left( 1 , 1 \\right)$.\nTwo pieces in each pair intersects at an interior point on the region.\nSo the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 - 1 = 15$.\nFinally, we compute the number intersection points of two functions' monotonic pieces that both attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nOne trivial intersection point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nNow, we study whether they intersect at another point.\nDefine $x = 1 - x'$ and $y = 1 - y'$.\nThus, for positive and sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, Function 1 is reduced to\n\\[ y' = 4 \\sin 2 \\pi x' \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\]\nand Function 2 is reduced to\n\\[ x' = 4 \\left( 1 - \\cos 3 \\pi y' \\right) . \\hspace{1cm} (2) \\]\nNow, we study whether there is a non-zero solution.\nBecause we consider sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, to get an intuition and quick estimate, we do approximations of the above equations.\nEquation (1) is approximated as\n\\[ y' = 4 \\cdot 2 \\pi x' \\]\nand Equation (2) is approximated as\n\\[ x' = 2 \\left( 3 \\pi y' \\right)^2  \\]\nTo solve these equations, we get $x' = \\frac{1}{8^2 \\cdot 18 \\pi^4}$ and $y' = \\frac{1}{8 \\cdot 18 \\pi^3}$.\nTherefore, two functions' two monotonic pieces that attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$ have two intersecting points.\nPutting all analysis above, the total number of intersecting points is $16 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(385) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",

    "solution": "This is a conditional probability problem. Bayes' Theorem states that \n\\[P(A|B)=\\dfrac{P(B|A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nin other words, the probability of $A$ given $B$ is equal to the probability of $B$ given $A$ times the probability of $A$ divided by the probability of $B$. In our case, $A$ represents the probability of winning the grand prize, and $B$ represents the probability of winning a prize. Clearly, $P(B|A)=1$, since by winning the grand prize you automatically win a prize. Thus, we want to find $\\dfrac{P(A)}{P(B)}$.\nLet us calculate the probability of winning a prize. We do this through casework: how many of Jen's drawn numbers match the lottery's drawn numbers? \nTo win a prize, Jen must draw at least $2$ numbers identical to the lottery. Thus, our cases are drawing $2$, $3$, or $4$ numbers identical. \nLet us first calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $2$ identical numbers to the lottery. Let Jen choose the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$; we have $\\dbinom42$ ways to choose which $2$ of these $4$ numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined $2$ of the $4$ numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other $2$ numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has $10-2-2=6$ numbers to choose the last $2$ numbers from. Thus, this case is $\\dbinom62$, so this case yields $\\dbinom42\\dbinom62=6\\cdot15=90$ possibilities. \nNext, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $3$ identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. This time, we have $\\dbinom43$ ways to choose the identical numbers and again $6$ numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since $3$ of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose $1$ more number, so this is $\\dbinom61$. This case yields $\\dbinom43\\dbinom61=4\\cdot6=24$. \nFinally, let us calculate the number of ways to all $4$ numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen. \nIn total, we have $90+24+1=115$ ways to win a prize. The lottery has $\\dbinom{10}4=210$ possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate $\\dbinom{10}4$ or actually even know that it has to be $\\dbinom{10}4$; it suffices to call it $a$ or some other variable, as it will cancel out later. However, let us just go through with this. The probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. Note that the probability of winning a grand prize is just matching all $4$ numbers, which we already calculated to have $1$ possibility and thus have probability $\\dfrac1{210}$. Thus, our answer is $\\dfrac{\\frac1{210}}{\\frac{115}{210}}=\\dfrac1{115}$.

Using Law of Cosines on $\\triangle BPC,$ we have \n\\begin{align*}\n81&=x^2+4x^2-4x^2\\cos(180-\\angle BAC) \\\\ \n&= 5x^2+4x^2\\cos(BAC). \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nSolving, we get $x=\\frac{45}{13}.$ Now we have a system of equations using Law of Cosines on $\\triangle BPA$ and $\\triangle CPA$, \\[AP^2=5^2+\\left(\\frac{45}{13}\\right)^2 -(10) \\left(\\frac{45}{13} \\right)\\cos(ABP)\\]\n\\[AP^2=10^2+4 \\left(\\frac{45}{13} \\right)^2 + (40) \\left(\\frac{45}{13} \\right)\\cos(ABP).\\]\nSolving, we find $\\overline{AP}=\\frac{100}{13}$, so our desired answer is $100+13=\\boxed{113}$.\n~evanhliu2009\nFollowing from the law of cosines, we can easily get $\\cos A = \\frac{11}{25}$, $\\cos B = \\frac{1}{15}$, $\\cos C = \\frac{13}{15}$.\nHence, $\\sin A = \\frac{6 \\sqrt{14}}{25}$, $\\cos 2C = \\frac{113}{225}$, $\\sin 2C = \\frac{52 \\sqrt{14}}{225}$.\nThus, $\\cos \\left( A + 2C \\right) = - \\frac{5}{9}$.\nDenote by $R$ the circumradius of $\\triangle ABC$.\nIn $\\triangle ABC$, following from the law of sines, we have $R = \\frac{BC}{2 \\sin A} = \\frac{75}{4 \\sqrt{14}}$.\nBecause $BD$ and $CD$ are tangents to the circumcircle $ABC$, $\\triangle OBD \\cong \\triangle OCD$ and $\\angle OBD = 90^\\circ$.\nThus, $OD = \\frac{OB}{\\cos \\angle BOD} = \\frac{R}{\\cos A}$.\nIn $\\triangle AOD$, we have $OA = R$ and $\\angle AOD = \\angle BOD + \\angle AOB = A + 2C$.\nThus, following from the law of cosines, we have\n\\begin{align*}\nAD & = \\sqrt{OA^2 + OD^2 - 2 OA \\cdot OD \\cos \\angle AOD} \\\\\n& = \\frac{26 \\sqrt{14}}{33} R.\n\\end{align*}\n\nFollowing from the law of cosines,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos \\angle OAD & = \\frac{AD^2 + OA^2 - OD^2}{2 AD \\cdot OA} \\\\\n& = \\frac{8 \\sqrt{14}}{39} .\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore,\n\\begin{align*}\nAP & = 2 OA \\cos \\angle OAD \\\\\n& = \\frac{100}{13} .\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the answer is $100 + 13 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(113) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)",

    "prompt": "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

    "solution": "Notice that the question's condition mandates all blues to go to reds, but reds do not necessarily have to go to blue. Let us do casework on how many blues there are. \nIf there are no blues whatsoever, there is only one case. This case is valid, as all of the (zero) blues have gone to reds. (One could also view it as: the location of all the blues now were not previously red.) Thus, we have $1$. \nIf there is a single blue somewhere, there are $8$ cases - where can the blue be? Each of these is valid. \nIf there are two blues, again, every case is valid, and there are $\\dbinom82=28$ cases. \nIf there are three blues, every case is again valid; there are $\\dbinom83=56$ such cases. \nThe case with four blues is trickier. Let us look at all possible subcases. \nIf all four are adjacent (as in the diagram below), it is obvious: we can simply reverse the diagram (rotate it by $4$ units) to achieve the problem's condition.

Thus, all of these cases work, and we have $2$ subcases. \nThere can not be more than $4$ blues, so we are done. \nOur total is $1+8+28+56+8+4+8+2=115$. There are $2^8=256$ possible colorings, so we have $\\dfrac{115}{256}$ and our answer is $115+256=\\boxed{371}$.\n~Technodoggo\nLet $r$ be the number of red vertices and $b$ be the number of blue vertices, where $r+b=8$. By the Pigeonhole Principle, $r\\geq{b} \\Longrightarrow b\\leq4$ if a configuration is valid.\nWe claim that if $b\\leq3$, then any configuration is valid. We attempt to prove by the following:\nIf there are \\[b\\in{0,1,2}\\] vertices, then intuitively any configuration is valid. For $b=3$, we do cases:\nIf all the vertices in $b$ are non-adjacent, then simply rotating once in any direction suffices. If there are $2$ adjacent vertices, then WLOG let us create a set $\\{b_1,b_2,r_1\\cdots\\}$ where the third $b_3$ is somewhere later in the set. If we assign the set as $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}$ and $b_3\\leq4$, then intuitively, rotating it $4$ will suffice. If $b_3=5$, then rotating it by 2 will suffice. Consider any other $b_3>5$ as simply a mirror to a configuration of the cases.\nTherefore, if $b\\leq3$, then there are $\\sum_{i=0}^{3}{\\binom{8}{i}}=93$ ways. We do count the [i]degenerate[/i] case.\nNow if $b=4$, we do casework on the number of adjacent vertices.\n0 adjacent: $\\{b_1,r_1,b_2,r_2\\cdots{r_4}\\}$. There are 4 axes of symmetry so there are only $\\frac{8}{4}=2$ rotations of this configuration.\n1 adjacent: WLOG $\\{b_1,b_2\\cdots{b_3}\\cdots{b_4}\\}$ where $b_4\\neq{8}$. Listing out the cases and trying, we get that $b_3=4$ and $b_4=7$ is the only configuration. There are $8$ ways to choose $b_1$ and $b_2$ and the rest is set, so there are $8$ ways.\n2 adjacent: We can have WLOG $\\{b_1,b_2\\cdots{b_3},b_4\\}$ or $\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\cdots\\}$ where $b_4\\neq{8}$. The former yields the case $b_3=5$ and $b_4=6$ by simply rotating it 2 times. The latter yields none. There are 2 axes of symmetry so there are $\\frac{8}{2}=4$ configurations.\n3 adjacent: WLOG $\\{b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\\cdots\\}$ which intuitively works. There are $8$ configurations here as $b_1$ can is unique.\nIn total, $b=4$ yields $2+8+4+8=22$ configurations.\nThere are $22+93=115$ configurations in total. There are $2^8=256$ total cases, so the probability is $\\frac{115}{256}$. Adding them up, we get $115+256=\\boxed{371}$.",

    "solution": "The third condition implies that the list's size must be an even number, as if it were an odd number, the median of hte list would surely appear in the list itself.\nTherefore, we can casework on what even numbers work.\nSay the size is 2. Clearly, this doesn't work as the only list would be $<cmath>9, 9</cmath>$, which doesn't satisfy condition 1.\nIf the size is 4, then we can have two $9$s, and a remaining sum of $12$. Since the other two values in the list must be distinct, and their sum must equal $30-18=12$, we have that the two numbers are in the form $a$ and $12-a$. Note that we cannot have both values greater than $9$, and we cannot have only one value greater than $9$, because this would make the median $9$, which violates condition 3. Since the median of the list is a positive integer, this means that the greater of $a$ and $12-a$ must be an odd number. The only valid solution to this is $a=5$. Thus, our answer is $5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2 = \\boxed{236}$. ~akliu\nIf there were an odd number of elements, the median would be in the set. Thus, we start with 4 elements. For 9 to be the mode, there must be 2 9s. For 9 to not be the median, either both numbers are greater than 9, or both numbers are less than 9. Clearly, both numbers must be less. From here, the numbers are clearly $(5,7,9,9)$, and we add their squares to get $\\boxed{236}$ -westwoodmonster\nWe can tell that the amount of integers in the list is an even number, because the median of the list doesn't appear in the list. The mode or the most frequent number in the list is 9, so there is more than one 9. We start with three 9's, because they will be easy to eliminate the cases. The list should look like \\[9,9,9,x\\] or \\[x,9,9,9\\]  in which both cases are impossible because the median is 9, which shows up in the list. The next case is 2 9's which looks like: \\[x,y,9,9\\] or \\[9,9,x,y\\] Where $x+y=12$ Because both elements of $x$ and $y$ cannot be greater than 9, the set looks like \\[x,y,9,9\\] and the only number that satisfy this case is 4,8 and 5,7 not 6 and 6 because 9 is the unique mode. it also states the median is an integer, so the pair is 5 and 7 and the set looks like \\[5,7,9,9\\] and \\[5^2+7^2+9^2+9^2=236\\]\n-Multpi12",
