{"prompt": "Description\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are rapidly entering our lives, but ensuring their responses resonate with users is critical for successful interaction. This competition presents a unique opportunity to tackle this challenge with real-world data and help us bridge the gap between LLM capability and human preference.\n\nWe utilized a large dataset collected from Chatbot Arena, where users chat with two anonymous LLMs and choose the answer they prefer. Your task in this competition is to predict which response a user will prefer in these head-to-head battles.\n\nThis challenge aligns with the concept of \"reward models\" or \"preference models\" in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Previous research has identified limitations in directly prompting an existing LLM for preference predictions. These limitations often stem from biases such as favoring responses presented first (position bias), being overly verbose (verbosity bias), or exhibiting self-promotion (self-enhancement bias).\n\nWe encourage you to explore various machine-learning techniques to build a model that can effectively predict user preferences. Your work will be instrumental in developing LLMs that can tailor responses to individual user preferences, ultimately leading to more user-friendly and widely accepted AI-powered conversation systems.\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on the log loss between the predicted probabilities and the ground truth values (with \"eps=auto\").\n\nSubmission File\n\nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for each target class.

In each user interaction, a judge provides one or more prompts to two different large language models and then indicates which of the models gave the more satisfactory response. The goal of the competition is to predict the preferences of the judges and determine the likelihood that a given prompt/response pair is selected as the winner.\n\nPlease note that this is a Code Competition.

{"prompt": "Description  \nWelcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series! Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to last year's Tabular Playground Series. And many thanks to all those who took the time to provide constructive feedback! We're thrilled that there continues to be interest in these types of challenges, and we're continuing the series this year but with a few changes.\n\nFirst, the series is getting upgraded branding. We've dropped \"Tabular\" from the name because, while we anticipate this series will still have plenty of tabular competitions, we'll also be having some other formats as well. You'll also notice freshly-upgraded (better looking and more fun!) banner and thumbnail images.\n\nSecond, rather than naming the challenges by month and year, we're moving to a Season-Edition format. This year is Season 3, and each challenge will be a new Edition. We're doing this to have more flexibility. Competitions going forward won't necessarily align with each month like they did in previous years (although some might!), we'll have competitions with different time durations, and we may have multiple competitions running at the same time on occasion.\n\nRegardless of these changes, the goals of the Playground Series remain the same\u2014to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. We hope we continue to meet this objective!\n\nTo start the year with some fun, January will be the month of Tabular Tuesday. We're launching four week-long tabular competitions, with each starting Tuesday 00:00 UTC. These will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.\n\nSynthetically-Generated Datasets  \nUsing synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated on the area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable stroke.

{"prompt": "Description  \nKaggle competitions are incredibly fun and rewarding, but they can also be intimidating for people who are relatively new in their data science journey. In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly. \n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation. \n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard. \n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals. \n\nThe dataset used for this competition is based on a real dataset but has synthetic-generated aspects to it. The original dataset deals with predicting air pollution in a city via various input sensor values (e.g., a time series). \n\nGood luck and have fun! For ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.\n\nEvaluation  \nSubmissions are evaluated using the mean column-wise root mean squared logarithmic error. \n\nThe RMSLE for a single column calculated as: \n\\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\log(p_i + 1) - \\log(a_i+1))^2 }\\] \n\nwhere:  \n- \\( n \\) is the total number of observations \n- \\( p_i \\) is your prediction \n- \\( a_i \\) is the actual value \n- \\( \\log(x) \\) is the natural logarithm of \\( x \\)\n\nThe final score is the mean of the RMSLE over all columns, in this case, 3.\n\nSubmission File  \nFor each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable.
